pandas is specifically designed for working with tabular data.

## Introduction to pandas Data Structures

### Series

A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object containing a sequence of values and an associated array of data labels, called its *index*.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

obj = pd.Series([4, 7, -5, 3])
obj
```

You can get the array representation and index object of the Series via its values and index attributes, respectively:

```{python}
obj.values

obj.index # like range(4)
```
