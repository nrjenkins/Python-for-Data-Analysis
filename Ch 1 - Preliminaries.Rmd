## What Is This Book About?

Covers the nuts and bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching data in Python. Focuses on the Python programming that is needed for data analysis of structured data.

## Essential Python Libraries

### NumPy

NumPy is short for Numerical Python and provides the data structures, algorithms, and library glue needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python. NumPy contains:

-   A fast and efficient multidimensional array object *ndarray*

-   Functions for preforming element-wise computations with arrays or mathematical operations between arrays

-   Tools for reading and writing array-based datasets to disk

-   Linear algebra operations, Fourier transform, and random number generation

-   A mature C API to enable Python extensions and native C or C++ code to access NumPy's data structures and computational facilities

### pandas

pandas provides high-level data structures and functions designed to make working with structured or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive. pandas provides the `DataFrame` functionality.

The `DataFrame` name was named after the similar R `data.frame` object. In R, data frames are built-in, so many of the features found in pandas are typically either part of the R core implementation of provided by additional packages.

### matplotlib

matplotlib is the most popular Python library for producing plots and other two-dimensional data visualizations.

### IPython and Jupyter

IPython is an interactive Python interpreter and Jupyter encompasses much of IPython.

### SciPy

SciPy is a collection of packages addressing a number of different standard problem domains in scientific computing. It contains important packages such as:

-   `scipy.integrate`: numerical integration and differential equation solvers

-   `scipy.linag`: linear algebra routines and matrix decompositions extending beyond those provided in `numpy.linalg`

-   `scipy.optimize`: function optimizers and root finding algorithms

-   `scipy.signal`: signal processing tools

-   `scipy.sparse`: sparse matrices and sparse linear system solvers

-   `scipy.special`: wrapper around SPECFUN, a Fortran library implementing many common mathematical functions, such as the `gamm` function

-   `scipy.stats`: standard continuous and discrete probability distributions, various statistical tests, and more descriptive statistics

Together NumPy and SciPy form a reasonably complete and mature computational foundation for many traditional scientific computing applications.

### scikit-learn

scikit-learn is the premier general-purpose machine learning toolkit for Python programmers. It includes submodules for such models as:

-   Classification: SVM, nearest neighbors, random forest, logistic regression, etc.

-   Regression: Lasso, ridge regression, etc.

-   Clustering: *k*-means, spectral clustering, etc.

-   Dimensionality reduction: PCA, feature selection, matrix factorization, etc.

-   Model selection: Grid search, cross-validation, metrics

-   Preprocessing: Feature extraction, normalization

### statsmodels

statsmodels is a statistical analysis package that brought many of the regression models from R to Python. It includes submodules for:

-   Regression models: linear regression, GLMs, robust linear models, linear mixed effects models, etc.

-   ANOVA

-   Time series analysis: AR, ARIMA, VAR, and others

-   Nonparametric methods: Kernel density estimation, kernel regression

-   Visualization of statistical model results

statsmodels is more focused on statistical inference where scikit-learn is more prediction-focused.

## Installation and Setup

Anaconda is an easy Python installer. Let's verify that things are installed correctly:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
python
```

### Installing or Updating Python Packages

You can install Python packages with the following command:

`conda install package_name`

Or, you can use the pip package management tool:

`pip install package_name`

You can update packages by using the `conda update` command:

`conda update package_name`

Or, with pip:

`pip install â€“upgrade package_name`

### Python 2 and Python 3

The first version of the Python 3.x line of interpreters was released at the end of 2008. Python 2.x will reach its development end of life in 2020.

### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Text Editors

-   PyDev (free)

-   PyCharm from JetBrains (free option)

-   Python Tools for Visual Studio (Windows only)

-   Spyder (free)

-   Komodo (commercial)

## Community and Conferences

-   pydata: a Google Group list for questions related to Python for data analysis and pandas

-   pystatsmodels: For statsmodels or pandas-related questions

-   mailing list of rscikit-learn

-   numpy-discussion

-   scipy-user

## Navigating This Book

### Import Conventions

The Python community has adopted a number of naming conventions for commonly used modules:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pylot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import statsmodels as sm
```

This means that when you see `np.arrange` this is a reference to the `arrage` function in NumPy. This is done because it's considered bad practice in Python software development to import everything(`from numpy import *`) from a large package like NumPy.

### Jargon

-   *munge/munging/wrangling*: describes the overall process of manipulating unstructured and/or messy data into a structured or clean form

-   *Pesudocode*: a description of an algorithm or process that takes a code-like form while likely not being actual valid source code

-   *Syntactic sugar*: programming syntax that does not add new features, but makes something more convenient or easier to type
